# Sets

1. A set can hold a collection of values which must be unique

2. It can contain a mix of different datat types. you can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same ste.

3. They do not maintain an insertion orddr - first element in tghe ste doesn't mean it has the first index

4. They are iterables

Sets Vs Arrays
- Arrays can contain duplicate values whereas Set cannot
- Insertion order is maintained in arrays and not in sets
- Searching and deleting an element in a set is faster
