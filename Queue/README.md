- The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of first in first out (FIFO). example, the queue at the ATM Machine 
- people enter the queue at onne end (REAR/TAIL) and leave the queue from the other end (FRONT/HEAD)
- Like the stack, it is an abstract data type definded by behaviour rather than a mathematical model

It supports two main operations;
1. Enqueue - adds element to the rear/tail of the collection
2. Dequeue - removes element from the front/head of the collection
peek() - get value of the first elmemnt at the front without removing it
peint() - visualize the elements
