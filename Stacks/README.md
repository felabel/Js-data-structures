# Stack data structure

The stack data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of Last in, first out. Example is a stack of plates.

The last insertd is the first removed.

Stack is an abstract dat type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model

The stack supports two main operations;
1. Push, which adds an element to the collection
2. Pop removes the last added element from the collection

When are stacks helpful

1. When you have to trace back your steps - e.g browser history tracking
2. Undo operations whn typing
3. Expression conversions
4. Call stack used in javascript runtime
